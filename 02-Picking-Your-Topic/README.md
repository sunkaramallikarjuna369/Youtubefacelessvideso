# Module 2: Picking Your Awesome Topic!

## Hey Krwutarth! Let's Find YOUR Perfect Topic!

Choosing what your channel is about is like picking your superpower. Pick the right one, and you'll have SO much fun making videos. Pick the wrong one, and it'll feel like homework!

## What is a "Niche"?

A **niche** (pronounced "neesh") is the specific topic your channel focuses on.

**Bad example:** "My channel is about everything!" (Too broad - no one knows what to expect)

**Good example:** "My channel is about Minecraft building tips!" (Specific - people know exactly what they'll get)

## The Golden Rule of Picking a Topic

Your topic should be something you:
1. **LIKE** - You'll be making lots of videos about it!
2. **KNOW** - Or are excited to learn about
3. **People SEARCH for** - Others want to watch it too

## Topics That Work Great for Kids

Here are some ideas that 12-year-olds have done successfully:

### Gaming
- Minecraft tips and tricks
- Roblox game reviews
- Fortnite highlights
- Mobile game tutorials

### Facts & Learning
- Amazing animal facts

## How to Find What People Are Searching For

### Method 1: YouTube Search (Super Easy!)

1. Go to YouTube
2. Start typing a topic in the search bar
3. Look at what YouTube suggests!

**Try this:** Type "minecraft" and see what comes up:
- minecraft tips
- minecraft building ideas
- minecraft survival guide

These suggestions mean LOTS of people search for these!

### Method 2: Google Trends (See What's Popular)

1. Go to: https://trends.google.com
2. Type in a topic
3. See if it's going UP or DOWN in popularity

**Pro tip:** Pick topics that are going UP!

### Method 3: Check Other Channels

1. Find successful faceless channels in topics you like
2. Look at their most popular videos
3. See what topics get the most views

## The "3 Questions" Test

Before picking your topic, ask yourself:

### Question 1: Can I make 100 videos about this?
If you pick "My favorite pizza" - that's maybe 1 video.
If you pick "Food facts" - that's HUNDREDS of videos!

### Question 2: Will people search for this in 1 year?
"Fidget spinner tricks" was huge in 2017, but not anymore.
"Minecraft tips" has been popular for 10+ years!

### Question 3: Can I make this without showing my face?
Some topics need you on camera. Pick ones that don't!

## Topics to AVOID

### Too Competitive
- "Funny videos" - Millions of channels do this
- "Music" - Hard to stand out

### Too Small
- "Left-handed origami for people named Bob" - Not enough viewers!

### Needs Your Face
- "My daily life vlogs" - Needs you on camera
- "Makeup tutorials" - Usually needs face

### Gets Old Fast
- Topics about ONE specific trend
- Things that won't matter in a year
