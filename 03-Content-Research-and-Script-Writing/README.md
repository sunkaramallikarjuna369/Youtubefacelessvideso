# Module 3: Content Research and Script Writing with AI

## The Content Creation Pipeline

Creating faceless YouTube videos starts with solid content research and well-written scripts. This module teaches you how to find trending topics, research content thoroughly, and use AI tools to write engaging scripts efficiently.

## Content Research Methods

### Method 1: Trending Topic Discovery

**YouTube Trending Tab**: Check the trending section in your niche category. Note what's getting views and why.

**Google Trends**: Search your niche keywords and explore related queries. Look for "Breakout" topics showing rapid growth.

**Reddit**: Join subreddits related to your niche. Popular posts indicate what your audience cares about. Sort by "Top" for the week or month.

**Twitter/X**: Follow thought leaders in your niche. Trending discussions often become video topics.

**News Aggregators**: Use Google News or Feedly to track industry news that could become video content.

### Method 2: Competitor Analysis

Study successful channels in your niche to understand what works:

1. List 10 channels in your niche with 10K-500K subscribers (not too big, not too small)
2. Sort their videos by "Most Popular"
3. Note common themes, titles, and formats
4. Identify gaps - topics they haven't covered or covered poorly
5. Check their recent uploads for current trends

### Method 3: Keyword Research

**YouTube Search Autocomplete**: Type your topic and note all suggestions. Each represents search demand.

**VidIQ/TubeBuddy Free**: Install these extensions to see search volume and competition for keywords.

**Answer The Public**: Enter your niche keyword to discover questions people ask.

**Also Asked**: Shows related questions people search for.

**Quora**: Search your niche to find common questions and pain points.

## Script Writing Fundamentals

### The Hook (First 30 Seconds)

The hook determines whether viewers stay or leave. Effective hooks include:

- **Question Hook**: "Have you ever wondered why millionaires wake up at 5 AM?"
- **Statistic Hook**: "90% of people fail at this, but today I'll show you how to succeed."
- **Story Hook**: "Last year, a college dropout made $1 million using this simple strategy."
- **Controversy Hook**: "Everything you've been told about investing is wrong."
- **Promise Hook**: "By the end of this video, you'll know exactly how to double your productivity."

### The Structure

**Problem-Solution Format**:
1. Introduce the problem (30 seconds)
2. Agitate the problem - why it matters (1 minute)
3. Present the solution (main content)
4. Summarize and call to action (30 seconds)

**List Format**:
1. Hook and preview (30 seconds)
2. Item 1 with explanation
3. Item 2 with explanation
4. Continue through all items
5. Bonus tip and call to action

**Story Format**:
1. Set the scene
2. Introduce conflict/challenge
3. Build tension
4. Resolution
5. Lesson learned

### Writing Tips for Engagement

- Write conversationally, as if talking to a friend
- Use short sentences for impact
- Include pattern interrupts every 30-60 seconds (questions, transitions, new visuals)
- Add specific numbers and examples
- Create curiosity gaps ("I'll reveal the secret in a moment")
- End sections with transitions to the next topic
